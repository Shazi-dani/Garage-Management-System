## Project Scope
The DT Autos Garage Management System will encompass a comprehensive user module with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring secure access for various user roles including Admin, Customer, and Garage Technician. The system will feature a customer management interface for registration, profile management, and a self-service portal to view service records and invoices. Employee management will include role assignments and detailed profiles, facilitating efficient operational workflows. A secure JWT-based authentication process will be implemented, along with role-based access control to regulate permissions for different functionalities, thereby ensuring a secure and streamlined user experience.

This project aims to streamline garage operations by providing an efficient platform for booking and managing automobile services. When you first start it, register and login, you will be on the home page which displays a dashboard with upcoming appointments and service details. The core functionality of this system is to enable customers to easily book their vehicles for servicing and other related tasks, allowing the garage to manage and schedule its operations effectively. In vehicle management, admins can add vehicle details including pictures and prices for vehicles that are for sale, and customers can view these vehicles and their details. This feature enhances the service offering by allowing customers to explore and purchase vehicles directly through the system.

Note: The system will track various services and generate statistics on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. For instance, it can show how many oil changes were performed in a week, the total revenue generated from specific services, and the overall performance of different technicians.

Note: For this system to work effectively, you need to create service categories (e.g., oil change, tire replacement) and when a booking is made, you can choose a service and time slot for that service on a particular date. The description for the service will narrow down the specifics of what needs to be done within the allocated time slot. When you want to see a breakdown of services provided for a particular category, you can navigate to statistics and choose a date range and service category. This will display a tabulated result for each task within the dates chosen, showing hours, minutes, date, and task details in a table, along with totals to show overall time and revenue for the service category within the chosen dates.

Services could include various maintenance and repair tasks, where you can manage multiple services/projects on a daily basis within specific time slots. The description would be crucial here to break down exactly what needs to be done within the time window on a particular date.

The DT Autos Management System will provide a comprehensive solution for managing garage operations, enhancing customer service, and improving administrative efficiency. This system will help garages to streamline their booking processes, track service performance, and gain valuable insights into their operations, ultimately leading to better time management and increased productivity.

## Design
![Responsiveness Design](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aac7a8eb-8297-4c65-ac06-7c492a02e448)
The design of the DT Autos Management System aims to create a user-friendly platform that streamlines the booking and management of automobile services while generating insightful statistics effortlessly. By focusing on ease of use, the system provides an intuitive interface for customers to register, login, and book services, as well as for administrators to manage these bookings efficiently. The dashboard offers a clear overview of daily tasks, allowing garages to plan and schedule operations effectively. Additionally, the system supports creating detailed service categories and descriptions, enabling precise tracking of time and resources. Comprehensive statistical tools allow users to analyze service performance on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, providing valuable insights into technician efficiency and service profitability, thus enhancing overall operational efficiency.

## Colour Scheme
The color scheme for the DT Autos Management System is based on a blue and white contrast, designed to create a clean, professional, and visually appealing user interface. The use of blue conveys trust, reliability, and calmness, which are crucial qualities for a service-oriented platform where users need to feel confident in their interactions. White, on the other hand, adds to the system’s clarity and simplicity, providing a sense of openness and space that enhances readability and reduces visual clutter. This combination ensures that users can navigate through the system effortlessly, with blue highlighting key elements and actions while white offers a pristine background that makes content stand out. The benefits of this color scheme include improved user focus, reduced eye strain during prolonged use, and an overall professional aesthetic that aligns with the system’s purpose of efficient and reliable service management.

## Typography 
The fonts i used for this project were plain, simple & easy to read and look pleasant to the eye. I have used the default [bootstrap css](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css) as the default typography and styling reference.

## Things To done in Future 

**Supplier Management & Inventory**
**Note:** Due to time constraints, it was not possible to implement the supplier management and inventory features at this time. However, we plan to develop and enhance these features in future updates.

####  Supplier Management

**Create:** Add new supplier information: first name, last name, company details, email,
mobile number, and address.
**Read:**  View detailed supplier profiles and communication history.
**Update:**  Edit and update supplier details as necessary.
**Delete:**  Remove suppliers from the system when no longer needed.
All these are The task to done in Future

## Bugs found during Project

Certainly! Here's an updated list of the bugs/issues you mentioned, including the bugs raised by your mentor, integrated into the same format for clarity:

---

### 1. **Heroku Deployment Crashing with Project Settings Path Issue**
   - **Issue:** When deploying to Heroku, the project was crashing due to a project settings path issue after deployment.
   - **Cause:** Upon investigating and consulting with the mentor, the issue was identified as a **wrong project file structure** that was causing the crash.
   - **Fix:** Restructured the project files correctly and adjusted paths to ensure compatibility with Heroku's deployment process. This resolved the issue and the project went live on Heroku.

---

### 2. **CSRF Token Error on Login Page**
   - **Issue:** User authentication was successful on the login page but resulted in a CSRF token error.
   - **Cause:** The CSRF token was missing in the HTML forms, and the CSRF token was not being properly handled in requests.
   - **Fix:** Added `{{ csrf_token }}` within the login and other relevant templates. Additionally, the domain was added to the `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` in the settings, resolving the issue.

---

### 3. **Appointment Creation Page Showing All Users**
   - **Issue:** The appointment creation page displayed a list of all users in a dropdown menu for the user field selection, which was not the intended behavior.
   - **Cause:** The user field for selecting the appointment owner was populated from a general user list, allowing any user to add an appointment for another user.
   - **Fix:** Updated the appointment model to automatically assign the logged-in user as the appointment owner instead of relying on user input for the user field. This prevents users from adding appointments for other users.

---

### 4. **Appointment Time Slot Validation**
   - **Issue:** Users were able to register for an appointment for any time slot within 24 hours, but appointments should only be allowed during the garage's official working hours.
   - **Cause:** The appointment creation page did not have a time slot validation for working hours.
   - **Fix:** Added validation to restrict appointment creation to only within the garage's working hours, ensuring appointments cannot be scheduled outside of this time range.

---

### 5. **Gitpod Server Host Error**
   - **Issue:** When trying to run the server on a Gitpod instance, the server was throwing a host-related error.
   - **Cause:** The project settings did not include the necessary hostname in the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting for Gitpod.
   - **Fix:** Explicitly added the Gitpod instance's hostname to the `ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting in the Django project settings, which resolved the error and allowed the server to run properly.

---

### 6. **Unclear if User Is Logged In or Not**
   - **Issue:** It was unclear if a user was logged in or not on various pages.
   - **Cause:** The application did not have a visible indicator or mechanism to check whether a user was logged in.
   - **Fix:** Implemented a user authentication check and displayed a logged-in status indicator in the user interface.

---

### 7. **No Login or Register Links**
   - **Issue:** There were no clear links or buttons for users to log in or register.
   - **Cause:** Missing links for user authentication in the navigation and layout templates.
   - **Fix:** Added login and register links to the appropriate pages and navigation elements, improving user accessibility to authentication features.

---

### 8. **No Notification Messages After CRUD and Authentication Actions**
   - **Issue:** The application did not provide feedback to users after performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations or authentication actions.
   - **Cause:** The app was missing notification messages to confirm actions like successful login, registration, or record modifications.
   - **Fix:** Added flash messages for all CRUD and authentication actions to provide feedback to the user (e.g., success or error messages after login, registration, or data modification).

---

### 9. **Unclear Logout Function**
   - **Issue:** It was unclear how to log out, as the logout functionality was not clearly implemented or visible.
   - **Cause:** Missing logout links and no clear logout mechanism in the user interface.
   - **Fix:** Added a logout link to the navigation bar and ensured that the `Logout` view works as expected using Django's built-in `logout()` function.

---

### 10. **No Error Pages (401, 403, 404, 500)**
   - **Issue:** The app did not have custom error pages for common HTTP errors like 401 (Unauthorized), 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).
   - **Cause:** The error handling system was not configured for custom error pages.
   - **Fix:** Created custom templates for error pages and configured Django to handle errors gracefully with specific pages for each error type (401, 403, 404, 500).

---

### 11. **Editing Other Users' Created Content**
   - **Issue:** Users were able to edit content or objects created by other users, which should not be allowed.
   - **Cause:** No proper access control in place to ensure that users can only edit their own content.
   - **Fix:** Implemented permission checks to ensure users can only edit their own created content and restricted access to others' content.

---

### 12. **Editing Appointments with Non-Logged-In Users (LoginRequiredMixin)**
   - **Issue:** Users who were not logged in could still try to edit appointments, which should be restricted to logged-in users only.
   - **Cause:** The `LoginRequiredMixin` was not applied to views for editing appointments.
   - **Fix:** Added `LoginRequiredMixin` to all appointment editing views to enforce login requirements before allowing access to these pages.

---

### 13. **Missing `base.html` Template (For Consistency)**
   - **Issue:** The project was missing a `base.html` template, which is a common convention in Django to ensure a consistent layout and structure across the app.
   - **Cause:** The application was lacking a central base template, leading to repetitive code across different templates.
   - **Fix:** Created a `base.html` template for the project to be used across all pages, centralizing common HTML structure like navigation, footer, and CSS/JS inclusions.

---

### 14. **README Should Use MoSCoW Prioritization for Task Management**
   - **Issue:** The README did not follow a structured approach for task prioritization, which could make it harder to track progress and organize tasks in an agile environment.
   - **Cause:** Missing MoSCoW (Must-haves, Should-haves, Could-haves, and Won't-haves) prioritization in the README.
   - **Fix:** Updated the README file to include a MoSCoW prioritization of tasks to help with project management and agile development.

---

### 15. **Commit Messages Not Descriptive Enough**
   - **Issue:** Commit messages were made regularly, but they were not descriptive enough to clearly explain the work, change, or feature implemented.
   - **Cause:** Generic commit messages that did not provide sufficient context about the changes.
   - **Fix:** Improved commit messages to be more descriptive, clearly explaining the purpose and impact of each commit.

---

### Summary of Fixes:

- Fixed project structure for Heroku deployment.
- Addressed CSRF token issues by adding the token and configuring `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`.
- Corrected the appointment model to ensure users can only book appointments for themselves.
- Restricted appointment bookings to within garage working hours.
- Fixed server host errors by adding the correct hostname to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in Gitpod.
- Enhanced user experience by adding login/logout functionality, user feedback, and improving error handling.
